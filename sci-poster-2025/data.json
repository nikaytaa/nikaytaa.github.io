The voiceover, originally from a creator in the US , is used by both Swati and Nisha to portray a good wife--good devotee while showcasing the various elements of the Sari.",

She presents five pieces of advice, three of which are highlighted in the poster. Here, I've documented the remaining two pieces of advice, providing a comprehensive understanding of Nisha's counsel. Number 3: Be his strength, not his weakness, in times of trouble, and do not become his trouble. Number 4: Respect his favourite member of the family and do not say bad things about them.",

It is revealed that MIL disapproves of Nisha talking to her mother. Nisha’s sister-in-law expresses to her mother (Nisha’s MIL) that as a future DIL, she will also not speak with her mother regularly. MIL realises her folly and says, “Youngsters are so much more understanding than elders”.",

Komal says, “My whole day is spent caring for them. No matter how much you do for in-laws, they will find a way to blame you for anything anytime (Ilzaam laga hi dete hai)”. The unfairness of this situation is evident in her words."

In these skits, the representation of patriarchy is often embodied by her mother-in-law or husband, and sometimes it is directed to the audience."

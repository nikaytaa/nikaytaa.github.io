  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>I am a gender scholar interested in learning about how society and technology interact and shape each other. My MA dissertation titled “Gender, Technology, and Violence: a case study of the auction apps that targeted Muslim women” unravels the historicity and motive of the online auction through literature research on misogyny in the meme-sphere and
    unmoderated digital communities.</p>
  <p>I am an endurance athlete with one full marathon and several half marathons under my shoes.</p>
  <h2>Research Interests</h2>
  <p>Feminist Science and Technology Studies, Feminist Theory, Masculinities</p>
